    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite â€” he considers it a special occasion every time I make them!
        The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination.
        Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.

            Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1
            minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the
            cheese.

            Bake the casserole: Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated
            oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.
